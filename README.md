This repository contains material, notebooks, scripts about Edge Computing and TensorFlow Lite.

Note that this repository will use relative linking. That means that
all the documentations (markdown files) can be accessed directly
from your laptop without the need of having access to internet
to get files from [GitHub](https://github.com/michelucci/Edge-computing-with-TensorFlow), once you have cloned the repository
on your machine. Of course it can be completely accessed directly
online from [GitHub](https://github.com/michelucci/Edge-computing-with-TensorFlow).

The material is divided in sections, each having its own folder.
In each folder you will find a `README.md` with a table of content and instructions of what you can find in the folder. Here you will find a high level table of content that should help you in navigating the material and finding what you need or search.

Mostly the material is presented with three different media types:

1. **Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts**:  those are scripts that can
be used to try and learn. The notebooks and scripts are mostly used for
the hands-on sessions.

2. **Google Slides**: the slides linked in this repository are not meant
to contain all the material in details, but are used as a guideline.
They show the reader/learner the main points that are important.

3. **Markdown files in the repository**: for some more technical material,
that is important and that requires more explanation I have provided
some markdown files that can be accessed directly online with more information
on specific technical issues.
